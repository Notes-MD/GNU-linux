# Operating Systems

Program is a file stored in the computer; process is that file performing certain action.
Two main ypes of programs:
<br>  a) applications (or apps): programs designed for specific use.
<br>  b) operating system software: series of software components used to control hardware.

Managing hardware is dealt by the kernel of an Operating System. Initially, dealing with hardware was all that an Operating System used to do; however with the introction of multiprocesses, Operating Systems also manage system resources program by program now, and also provide a user-interface.

Opetating system loads into computer memory when computer's turned on. Next, it loads the programs that display the interface. From within the interface, the user can execute commands to tell the operating system and other applications to perform specific task. The operating system then uses the computer hardware to performm the task required by the applications.

Operating system that have the ability to manage multiple tasks at the same time, and allow multuple users to access the system simultaneosly are reffered as **multiuser** and **multitasking** operating systems.

A **Server** is a computer with an operating system that is configured to allow other computers to connect to it from accross a network.
